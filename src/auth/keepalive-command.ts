 * request a day keeps a session alive indefinitely, while five idle days end it for good. The
 * bootstrap already merges the refreshed cookie into the jar under its advisory lock, so a
 * keepalive that fires while a client has the server open cannot clobber either refresh.
 *
 * A session that has already lapsed cannot be revived. `OverleafRuntime.create` then throws
 * `AUTH_EXPIRED`, which must propagate: Overleaf's login redirect hands out an anonymous cookie
 * that replaces the dead one in the jar, and that must never be reported as a refresh.
